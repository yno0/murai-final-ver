  - Connected to real API instead of mock data
  - Added language and category filters
  - Implemented CRUD operations for word groups
  - Added loading states and error handling
  - Created reusable WordGroupModal component
  - Real-time statistics based on actual data
- **src/admin/services/adminApi.js**: Added new API methods:
  - `getWordsWithVariations(params)`

### 4. Updated Backend API Endpoints ✅

#### New Admin Dictionary Endpoints:
- `POST /api/admin/dictionary/export` - Export with filters
- `POST /api/admin/dictionary/import` - Bulk import with options

#### New Dictionary Endpoints:

- `GET /api/dictionary/with-variations` - Get words with variations

#### Enhanced Features:
- Comprehensive logging for all admin actions
- Detailed error reporting for import operations
- Progress tracking for bulk operations
- Filter support for exports

## Technical Improvements
